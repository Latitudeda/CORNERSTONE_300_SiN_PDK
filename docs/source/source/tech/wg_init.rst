__init__.py
===================

Define the WG class which consists of ``SIN_STRIP.C.WIRE`` and ``SIN_STRIP.O.WIRE`` class. The width of the waveguide is set here according the parameters in ``constant.py`` file. **PhotoCAD** also support CD bias control of the waveguide width. The CD bias setting can be implemented in ``SIN_STRIP.py``.
